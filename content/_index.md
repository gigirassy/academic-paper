Click the above links. Things might have changed style-wise, but as of 09/30/25, we have still not been served a warrant, subpoena, or forced to comply with a secret law enforcement/government request. Hence, warrant canary Squawktalk has not left. If he does, run. <span style="float:right;">![squawktalk](/squawktalk.png)</span> 


**Terms of Service:** Don't be the reason why Squawktalk leaves and you should be good.

## Recent updates:
* Redlib is no longer public due to clankers and is under basic auth. To access it, unabbreviate the subdomain (rl), put it backwards, add .blitzw.in to it, and log in with username ``guest`` and the password, which is the name of my favorite character, but with Is replaced with exclamation marks.
* Breezewiki has been deprecated.
* Privatebin and Send are back.
* Invidious is on hold for now.

## Donations?

I have optimized costs on my services so it costs very little to run them, approx 7.70 USD per month. Hence, donations aren't needed and I can easily cover costs within a few of my typical surveys. Instead, consider giving your money to any of the following organizations that are dear to me:
* [Louisana Abortion Fund](https://www.louisianaabortionfund.org/donate)
* [Chicago Community Jail Support](https://chicago-community-jail-support.webnode.page/donate/)
* [Trans Youth Emergency Project](https://southernequality.org/tyep/)
* [Midwest Books to Prisoners](https://midwestbookstoprisoners.org/)
* [Sameer Project](https://chuffed.org/project/113327-refaat-alareer-camp-the-sameer-project)
